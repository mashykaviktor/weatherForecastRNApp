# Weather Forecast App

This is a Weather Forecast App built with React Native that provides real-time weather information for the user's current location and a 5-day weather forecast. The app makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for different locations.

# Features

# Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm
React Native CLI
Xcode (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development)

# Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecast-app.git
cd weather-forecast-app

Install dependencies:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

## For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you will see the Weather screen displaying the current weather conditions for your current location. To view the 5-day weather forecast, navigate to the Forecast screen by tapping on the corresponding button in the bottom navigation.

To search for weather conditions in a different location, use the search bar on the Weather screen. Type the city name, and the app will display the weather information for the searched location.

All the cities you enter will be saved. When entering a city that was already in your list, it will not be saved again. The saved cities will be displayed on the Weather screen under the search box for quick access to their weather conditions.
